## 🚀 Problem Statement

Independent artists face critical hurdles in the digital age:

- **Pricing Uncertainty**  
  Amateur creators struggle to accurately value their unique pieces.

- **Engagement Friction**  
  Bidders often miss live auction windows due to passive notification systems.

- **Provenance Tracking**  
  Verifying the *Chain of Ownership* is difficult and prone to fraud.

  Instant appraisal and storytelling using multimodal AI.
