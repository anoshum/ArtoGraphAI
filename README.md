# ArtoGraph ✨  
## The Future of Fair-Trade Art  
### Empowering Creators through AI and Automated Royalties

**ArtoGraph** is an  ecosystem for artists and collectors, built for **GDG TechSprint 2025**.  
By leveraging the power of **Google Gemini**, **Google Pay**, and **Firebase**, we bridge the gap between traditional art commerce and the modern creative economy.

## Problem Statement
Independent artists face critical hurdles in the digital age:

- **Secondary Market Loss**  
  Artists receive **$0** when their artwork is resold later for a higher value.

- **Pricing Uncertainty**  
  Amateur creators struggle to accurately value their unique pieces.

- **Engagement Friction**  
  Bidders often miss live auction windows due to passive notification systems.

- **Provenance Tracking**  
  Verifying the *Chain of Ownership* is difficult and prone to fraud.

## Key Features

- **AI Art Appraiser**  
  Upload a photo and let Gemini suggest a price based on style, complexity, and detail.

- **Automated Resale Royalties**  
  Original artists automatically receive **10% royalty** on every future resale.

- **Live Bidding Vault**  
  A real-time, high-stakes auction environment for verified collectors.

- **Immutable Provenance Ledger**  
  Transparent lifetime ownership history for every artwork.

- **Category Discovery**  
  AI-driven semantic search to discover art that matches your personal *vibe*.
